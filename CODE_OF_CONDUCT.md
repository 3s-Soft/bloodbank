# Bloodbank Community Code of Conduct

## 1. Purpose

A primary goal of Bloodbank is to foster an inclusive and welcoming community for contributors of all backgrounds. We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and harassment-free environment for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, religion (or lack thereof), or level of experience.

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite all those who participate in Bloodbank to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

## 2. Open Source Citizenship

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to promote open source citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist, and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, please let us know.

## 3. Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

*   Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
*   Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions, both online and offline.
*   Attempt collaboration before conflict.
*   Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
*   Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
*   Respect the privacy of others. Do not share personal information without consent.

## 4. Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:

*   Violence, threats of violence, or violent language directed against another person.
*   Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
*   Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
*   Posting or threatening to post other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
*   Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability, or other personal attributes.
*   Inappropriate photography or recording, especially without consent.
*   Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone's explicit consent before touching them.
*   Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes sexualized comments or jokes, inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances.
*   Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following (online or in person).
*   Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.
*   Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
*   Online harassment, including cyberbullying, trolling, and the use of offensive or discriminatory usernames or avatars.

## 5. Weapons Policy

No weapons will be allowed at Bloodbank events, community spaces, or in other spaces covered by the scope of this Code of Conduct. Weapons include but are not limited to guns, explosives (including fireworks), and large knives such as those used for hunting or display, as well as any other item used for the purpose of causing injury or harm to others. Anyone seen in possession of one of these items will be asked to leave immediately and will only be allowed to return without the weapon. Community members are further expected to comply with all state and local laws on this matter.

## 6. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).

## 7. Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible at admin@3s-soft.com. All reports will be kept confidential.

Additionally, community organizers are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.

## 8. Addressing Grievances

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify admin@3s-soft.com with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with the Bloodbank Community Guidelines, available at [link to guidelines].

## 9. Scope

We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues--online and in-person--as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.

This code of conduct and its related procedures also apply to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members. This includes social media, personal blogs, and other online platforms.
